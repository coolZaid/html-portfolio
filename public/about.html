<h1>About Me</h1>
<p> Hello Everyone,<br>
  </p>
  <p> My name is Salma and I'm a mother of 3 kids. Life as a mom is incredibly challenging, but I’ve always 
    had a dream of building something of my own, something that combines creativity and technology.
    So, I’ve decided to embark on a new adventure and become a web developer.</p>
    <p> I have started my journey with the basics: HTML and CSS.
      I’ve learned to celebrate every bit of progress, no matter how small. Completing a coding exercise,
       solving a bug, or even understanding a new concept feels incredibly rewarding.</p>
     <p> Hopefully, I will continue to move ahead withthe same focus and determination that I have started with and move ahead taking one mini step at a 
       time.
    </p>
